### About

I am a Master’s student in Economics at Singapore Management University with interests in applied microeconomics, econometrics, and public policy. My work focuses on using data and empirical methods to understand economic behavior and policy outcomes.

This website is a personal academic repository for my research, tutorials, and notes. It is designed as a resource for students taking economics courses, as well as a space to document and reflect on my academic work.

I use this page to share teaching materials, working papers, and ideas in progress. Comments and feedback are welcome.

### What You’ll Find Here

This website is a personal academic space where I share my research projects, tutorial materials, notes, and ongoing work in economics. I also use this page to document ideas in progress and reflect on topics I am currently studying.

I welcome feedback, comments, and discussion on the materials shared here, including working papers and blog posts.

### Feedback and Discussion

I believe academic work improves through discussion and constructive feedback.  
Readers are welcome to share comments, suggestions, or questions on my papers, tutorials, and blog posts.

If you are a student using these materials or a reader interested in the topics, feel free to reach out or leave feedback where available.

### For Students

Selected tutorial notes and teaching materials are shared on this site for students studying economics and mathematics at the undergraduate and master’s level. These materials are intended as learning supplements rather than complete lecture replacements.
