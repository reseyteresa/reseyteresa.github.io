This paper examines how the perceived complexity of Singapore’s Build-To-Order (BTO) housing policy affects public understanding, acceptance, and satisfaction. Using a mixed-method approach combining a heuristic usability assessment of the HDB website and a cross-sectional survey of university students and faculty, the study evaluates how policy communication and accessibility shape housing perceptions.

The findings show that while Singapore’s housing policies are fundamentally affordable and well-designed, information delivery plays a critical role in shaping public attitudes. Many respondents struggled to navigate eligibility criteria and grant information, leading to delays or reconsideration of BTO applications. Importantly, perceptions of affordability improved after respondents were shown simplified explanations and realistic mortgage calculations, highlighting the role of transparent communication. The results suggest that dissatisfaction with public housing is driven less by policy failure and more by complexity in presentation, with important implications for policy design and public trust.
